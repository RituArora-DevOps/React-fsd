                This is the functione we defined in the parent component, CurrencyConverter.js to handle the state update. This is called a callback function. Calling a function inside a child componenet from a parent component is called lifting state up.
                In other words, we are lifting the state up from the child component to the parent component.or
                The child passes the new value upward to the parent â€” this is a classic case of "lifting state up" in React.*/}
